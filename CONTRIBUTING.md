## Style Guide

Try to maintain the style of the files around you until we adopt a more defined style guide.

## Merging

A large part of open source is about trust, therefore all attendees and community members have been given administrator access to this repo.  As responsible project maintainers, we **should not** merge our own changes directly.  Please ask any attendee to look at and review your pull requests instead of doing it yourself.  There are enough people here that you should be able to collect **no less than 3 :+1:'s** or other encouraging emoji before a pull request "lands".  Thanks for understanding!
